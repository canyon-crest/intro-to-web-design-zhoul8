    <h3>Personal experience</h3>
    <p>I started baking bread in middle school and aquired a sourdough starter, which later died due to neglect.
        My hands-on bread experience is limited to a few years.</p>
    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <p>The world of breadmaking has many words and phrases, many of which I am unaware of. However, I do make use of those I know. Here's a table of some basic words for your convenience:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Word</th>
            <th>Definition</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Gluten</th>
            <th>What gives dough its structure. The bubbles yeast produces get trapped in it, forming the signature holes.</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Crumb</th>
            <th>The part of the bread which is not the crust. Usually used when asking about the air holes.</th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h3>Bread Factors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Protein content</h3> Protein isn't just for bodybuilders; the amount of it in your 
        flour is positively correlated with the gluten production. Cakeflour, flour mixed with cornstarch(very little protein)
        , has very little gluten formation, even after kneading. It is ideal for the light texture of cake, not bread.
        All purpose flour has approximately 10 to 12 percent protein, which is usually fine for lower hydration breads.</li>
    </ul>
